# Projects  

This folder will contain my larger cybersecurity-related projects.

## ðŸš€ Planned Ideas  
- **Custom Honeypot** â€” simple Python-based honeypot that logs connections  
- **Log Analyzer** â€” script to detect brute force login attempts  
- **Password Strength Tool** â€” Python app to evaluate password security  
- **Network Monitor** â€” basic IDS-style script to alert on suspicious traffic

## ðŸ“‚ Structure  
Each project will live in its own folder, e.g.:  
- `/honeypot/`  
- `/log-analyzer/`  
- `/password-tool/`
