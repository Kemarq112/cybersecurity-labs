# Writeups  

This folder contains my Capture The Flag (CTF) and lab challenge writeups.  

---

## 📝 Planned Platforms  
- **TryHackMe** — beginner-friendly cybersecurity labs  
- **HackTheBox** — advanced penetration testing labs  
- **CTFs** — writeups from competitions or practice challenges

## 📂 Structure  
Each challenge/lab will get its own file, e.g.:  
- `tryhackme_intro.md`  
- `htb_blue.md`  

Inside each file, I’ll include:  
- Objectives  
- Steps taken (commands, screenshots, analysis)  
- Key takeaways & lessons learned
